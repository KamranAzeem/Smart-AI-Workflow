STATE-FILE: progress.md is the PAST. Append-only history of completed work.
STATE-FILE: CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. Oldest at the top, newest at the bottom. Append new entries at the tail. Never insert, prepend, edit, delete, or reorder existing entries. The horizon shield archives the oldest entries when the file grows too long.
STATE-FILE: KEEP LEAN. Short bullet entries, one to two lines each. Not a runbook, plan, or ledger. No implementation steps, commands, investigation notes, or knowledge content. Use ai/shared/project-knowledge/ for durable knowledge.
